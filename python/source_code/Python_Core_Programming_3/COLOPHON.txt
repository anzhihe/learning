"Core Python Applications Programming", 3rd edition
by Wesley J. Chun

"Core Python Programming" is maintained using Adobe FrameMaker.
When parts I and II were split up into two books, both have been
maintained there. In this book (part II), a number of new chapters
have been added, some originally created in Google Docs then
exported to Word format and finally imported into FrameMaker.

The remaining new material was composed in raw text using (g)vim
in separate files. They were then imported into Adobe FrameMaker
and edited along with the preexisting part II from the 2nd edition
of "Core Python Programming." After copyedit, the book was further
edited, then composited and typeset, all by Octal Publishing
(octalpub.com).

The following fonts were used: Myriad Pro, Palatino Linotype,
Lucida Sans Typewriter Standard, and Zapf Dingbats Standard. The
book is printed in the United States on 45# Williamsburg Offset
Smooth Recycled paper by Edwards Brothers in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The prepress consisted of computer-to-plate technology (in a
filmless manner). The cover was printed by Moore Langen in Terre
Haute, Indiana. 

The images appearing on the cover of all three editions of this
book depict solving problems (whether as friendly shapes,
building blocks, or puzzle pieces). Python is a modular language
which allows programmers to more easily build and select components
to build applications with. With Python creator Guido van Rossum's
philosophy of (usually) having only one (right) way of doing things,
you seldom have to worry about fitting a square peg into a round
hole. "Python fits your brain," noted Bruce Eckel, Python fan and
author of "Thinking in Java" and "Thinking in C++".
